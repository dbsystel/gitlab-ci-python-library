Thanks for your interest in our project.

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to [open an issue])(issues) with questions or reporting ideas and bugs,
or [open pull requests](pulls) to contribute code.

Currently this project is an early implementation of an idea with a lot of influences from the daily
use in our pipelines at deutschebahn.com. Not yet ready designed we might still publish breaking changes.

We also have a strong opinion of how this library should be designed. That means not all contributions
would be accepted as-is. Please respect if we enforce changes to contributions or deny some. However
our opinion of how things work are changing, so discussions are welcomed.

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free environment. Be kind!
