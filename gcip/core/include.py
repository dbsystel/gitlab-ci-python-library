"""This module represents the Gitlab CI [Include](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#include) keyword.

Use include to include external YAML files in your CI/CD configuration.

----

[include:local](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#includelocal) example:

```
pipeline.add_include(IncludeLocal("/templates/.gitlab-ci-template.yml"))
```

----

[include:file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#includefile) example:

```
pipeline.add_include(IncludeFile(
        project="my-group/my-project",
        ref="master",
        file="/templates/.gitlab-ci-template.yml"
    ))
```

----

[include:remote](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#includeremote) example:

```
pipeline.add_include(IncludeRemote("https://gitlab.com/example-project/-/raw/master/.gitlab-ci.yml"))
```

----

[include:template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#includetemplate) example:

```
pipeline.add_include(IncludeTemplate("Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml"))
```

----

Special type of include: Use a `gcip.core.job.TriggerJob` with `IncludeArtifact` to run [a child pipeline with a generated
configuration file from a previous job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#trigger-child-pipeline-with-generated-configuration-file):

```
TriggerJob(includes=IncludeArtifact(job="generate-config", artifact="generated-config.yml"))
```

Note: The `IncludeArtifact` isn't implemented very well as it currently cannot handle `gcip.core.job.Job` objects. You need to know the jobs final name,
which is not very handy. This could be implemented much better in future.
