class EnvProxy:
    """This proxy delays the operating system query for environment variables until the value is requested.

    This proxy is designed for requesting predefined environment variables that must
    exist within a Gitlab CI pipeline execution. Create an object from this proxy
    with the name of the Gitlab `CI_*` variable you want to query:

    ```
    CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG = EnvProxy("CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG")  # os.environ is not (!) called here
    ...
    ```

    When using an object of this proxy in a statement it returns the value of the `CI_*`
    variable requested or raises a `KeyError` if against our expectations the variable
    is not available.

    ```
    ...
    if CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG == "foobar":  # <- os.environ is called here
        ...
    ```

    The proxy has a different behavior when not being called within a Gitlab CI pipeline
    execution. This is, when the environment variable `CI` is unset (from the official
    Gitlab CI docs). Then the proxy does not raise a KeyError for `CI_*` variables, because
    they naturally does not exist (or at least their existence is not guaranteed).
    So if we are not running within a Gitlab CI pipeline, the proxy insteads returns the
    dummy string `notRunningInAPipeline` for all `CI_*` variables. Except for the `CI`
    variable itself, where an empty string is returned, indicating we are not running
    within a pipeline

    Args:
        key (str): The name of the environment variable that should be queried on request.

        # returning an empty string
