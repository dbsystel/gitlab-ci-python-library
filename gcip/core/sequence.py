"""A Sequence collects multiple `gcip.core.job.Job`s and/or other `Sequence`s into a group.

This concept is no official representation of a Gitlab CI keyword. But it is such a powerful
extension of the Gitlab CI core funtionality and an essential building block of the gcip, that
it is conained in the `gcip.core` module.

A Sequence offers a mostly similar interface like `gcip.core.job.Job`s that allows to modify
all Jobs and child Sequences contained into that parent Sequence. For example: Instad of calling
`add_tag()` on a dozens of Jobs you can call `add_tag()` on the sequence that contain those Jobs.
The tag will then be applied to all Jobs in that Sequence and recursively to all Jobs within child
Sequenes of that Sequence.

Sequences must be added to a `gcip.core.pipeline.Pipeline`, either directly or as part of other Sequences.
That means Sequences are not meant to be a throw away configuration container for a bunch ob Jobs.
This is because adding a Job to a Sequence creates a copy of that Job, which will be inderectly added to
the `Pipeline` by that Sequence. Not adding that Sequence to a Pipeline means also not adding its Jobs
to the Pipeline. If other parts of the Pipeline have dependencies to those Jobs, they will be broken.

As said before, adding a Job to a Sequence creates copies of that Job. To void conflicts between Jobs,
you should set `name` and/or `namespace` when adding the job (or child sequence). The sequence will add
the `name` / `namespace` to the ones of the Job, when rendering the pipeline. If you do not set those
identifiers, or you set equal name/namespaces for jobs and sequences, you provoke having two or more
jobs having the same name in the pipeline. The gcip will raise a ValueError, to avoid unexpected
pipeline behavior. You can read more information in the chapter "Namespaces allow reuse of jobs
and sequences" of the user documantation.
